# escrave

Escrave is a front-end web app made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery.
It helps you keep track of spending and use habits for behaviors you want to cut back on.
The little voice in your head encouraging you to do more than you should often slips through the cracks.
Escrave puts a focus on your Best Behaviour.
It asks you to track the number of times you wanted to give in to cravings, but didnt, 
and allows you to set a goal for not doing or buying your guilty pleasure.

Once you have input enough information, the app starts to spit out statistics on that information:<br />
-Time since last bought<br />
-Amount spent:<br />
__-today<br />
__-this week<br />
__-this month<br />
__-this year<br />

-Time since last done<br />
-Number of times done<br />
-Number of times resisted<br />
-Times resisted in a row<br />
-Ratio of times done vs. resisted<br />
-Average time between doing it<br />
-Time until goal is achieved<br />
<br />
Version 2 updates:<br />
-any of these statistics can be toggled from the settings menu<br />
-the inputs can be done from any page<br />
-the app now starts by asking very simple baseline information<br />
-baseline information and clicks in the app now form weekly reports<br />
-users will be alerted of new reports, if the report has any data in it<br />
-reports show <br />
__+ A bar chart per day of uses and resists, <br />
__+ Percent change of Uses and Spent since last week <br />
__+ Percent change of Uses and Spent vs. baseline<br />
__+ Raw difference in Uses and Spent vs. initial goal<br />
