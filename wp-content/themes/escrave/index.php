      showing the date ended and the total amount of time elapsed.

    Goals can be ended early, if you mark that you have spent money on your habit/done it. 
    Goals can also be extended, by creating a new goal further into the future. 
    Any amount of progress is still progress, so every ended goal is added to your habit log!

      When attempting to cut back, it's essential to make smart goals.

      Any progress you make is good progress, so acknowledge your successes no matter how small they seem.

                                  escrave can be used to track nearly anything you want in terms of doing or buying something less often.
                                  The app makes the most sense if your chosen habit is related to a specific action and can be spent
                                  money on.
                                  So try to think of things you do or spend more money on than you would like.

					<h3>The old paradigm:</h3>
					<p>
					  When people fail at ‘quitting’ something, they tend to give up trying to quit entirely. So even if they
					  lasted a lot longer than they normally do, they feel like they failed and so stop trying to achieve
					  their goals. That’s why escrave is based on helping you make gradual improvements until you feel that
					  you do your guilty pleasure at an acceptable amount, rather than being focused entirely on quitting.
					</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="method-chunk">
					<h3>Committing to logging:</h3>
					<p>
					  You might say that opening escrave and entering in data every time you do or buy your guilty pleasure
					  is too much of a time commitment. I would say that extra time commitment is directly in line with the
					  purpose of this app. The longer you can wait, the greater the chance that you will be able to resist.
					</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="method-chunk">
					<h3>Making conscious decisions:</h3>
					<p>
					  Whenever you open escrave to mark a behavior, you are presented with consciously committing to a choice
					  to do or not to do. If you’ve made a conscious decision to cut back, being reminded of your own
					  commitment at the last moment could be the difference between doing or not.
					</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="method-chunk">
					<h3>Recognizing and accepting cravings:</h3>
					<p>
					  It’s not so difficult to know how much you spend on a habit, most people are already keeping track in
					  their heads. You can probably convert the money into an approximation of how much you do your habit,
					  however, figuring out how many times you consider doing it but decide not to, is nearly impossible
					  without help. Recognizing those incremental successes is incredibly important, because they are
					  entirely what your end goal is composed of. escrave helps you give that choice of inaction enough
					  weight that it doesn’t slip through the cracks.
					</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="method-chunk">
					<h3>Extending escrave</h3>
					<p>
					  For escrave to be effective, you must consistently log your behaviors into it, so how can you get into
					  the habit of opening escrave each time you do your guilty pleasure? First, you should figure out the
					  physical location where you go to do/buy it. Then, put a reminder somewhere that you can see it. For
					  example, if you are tracking cigarettes, a post-it note on your pack could do the trick.

                  I <em>am</em> planning to do some opt-in research with this app to finish my undergrad in style,

                  <p>
                    Midway through my psychology degree, I realized that I would need something extra if I were going to be successful in life.
                    So I designed the hell out of a simple application, thinking the idea was so powerful, it would take off.
                    I encouraged a friend of mine in a computer science undergrad program to help me build it,
                    which is when I discovered that I didn't really know the scope of what I was asking him,
                    and didn't have as detailed a vision as I would need to build out the app.
                     dropped out of school and learn how to code.
