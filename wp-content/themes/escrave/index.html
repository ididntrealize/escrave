              <h3>Track Cost</h3>
            <h4>When you spend on your habit</h4>
            <p>
              By clicking a buy button when you make a habit-related purchase,
              you can track how much you spend over time, how long it’s been
              since the last time you’ve spent money on your habit, and how long
              on average you wait in between purchases. escrave also makes you a
              breakdown of what you've spent total, this week, this month, and
              this year.

            <h3>Track use</h3>
            <h4>When you do your habit</h4>
            <p>
              By clicking on a button whenever you do your habit, you will be able
              to know the amount of time how long it's been since you last did it, and how long on average you wait.
              Simultaneously, escrave presents you with an option to click when you don’t do it.
              When you click for your resisted cravings, you can track the ratio between how often
              you give in to a craving versus successfully resisting a craving. Your body may
              already be subconsciously choosing not to give in to your cravings very often, without you noticing.
              escrave makes it more obvious, by telling you how many cravings you've resisted in a row.

            <h4>To effectively manage your habit</h4>
            <p>
              escrave gives you the ability to declare goals, which subsequently
              start a countdown timer that you can refer to at any time to see
              the current amount of time left to complete your goal. Every time
              a goal ends, the app will automatically add it to a list of
              completed goals showing the date ended and the total amount of
              time elapsed. Goals can be ended early, if the user marks that
              they have spent money on their habit or done it. With the idea
              that any amount of progress is still progress, these goals are
              also added to your goal log!

              escrave is available to use <i>without creating an account</i> and
              operates entirely on your personal device. This means that we do
              not store any of the data you create with it. The decentralized
              nature of data created by this app makes it much harder for other
              companies to collect or use.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an added level of security and anonymity, you do not specify to escrave 
              what you’re using it to track. That makes it
              easier to be honest with the app, as you are the only person
              judging yourself for how frequent you do it or how much you spend on
              it.

                      No matter how strong their resolution, people's habit(s) can start to get the best of them.
                      If you're struggling to find something that you could track,
                      this page can help you figure out what your guilty pleasure is.
                      escrave can be used to track nearly anything you want in terms of doing or buying something less often.
                      The app makes the most sense if your chosen habit is related to a specific action and can be spent
                      money on.
                      So try to think of things you do or spend more money on than you would like.

                <h3>The old paradigm:</h3>
                <p>
                  When people fail at ‘quitting’ something, they tend to give up trying to quit entirely. So even if they
                  lasted a lot longer than they normally do, they feel like they failed and so stop trying to achieve
                  their goals. That’s why escrave is based on helping you make gradual improvements until you feel that
                  you do your guilty pleasure at an acceptable amount, rather than being focused entirely on quitting.

                <h3>Committing to logging:</h3>
                <p>
                  You might say that opening escrave and entering in data every time you do or buy your guilty pleasure
                  is too much of a time commitment. I would say that extra time commitment is directly in line with the
                  purpose of this app. The longer you can wait, the greater the chance that you will be able to resist.

                <h3>Making conscious decisions:</h3>
                <p>
                  Whenever you open escrave to mark a behavior, you are presented with consciously committing to a choice
                  to do or not to do. If you’ve made a conscious decision to cut back, being reminded of your own
                  commitment at the last moment could be the difference between doing or not.

                <h3>Recognizing and accepting cravings:</h3>
                <p>
                  It’s not so difficult to know how much you spend on a habit, most people are already keeping track in
                  their heads. You can probably convert the money into an approximation of how much you do your habit,
                  however, figuring out how many times you consider doing it but decide not to, is nearly impossible
                  without help. Recognizing those incremental successes is incredibly important, because they are
                  entirely what your end goal is composed of. escrave helps you give that choice of inaction enough
                  weight that it doesn’t slip through the cracks.

                <h3>Extending escrave</h3>
                <p>
                  For escrave to be effective, you must consistently log your behaviors into it, so how can you get into
                  the habit of opening escrave each time you do your guilty pleasure? First, you should figure out the
                  physical location where you go to do/buy it. Then, put a reminder somewhere that you can see it. For
                  example, if you are tracking cigarettes, a post-it note on your pack could do the trick.

                  You're probably wondering what's the catch for this application?
                  Many people are worried these days that the applications they use 
                  are gathering data on them, for sale to marketers. 
                  escrave runs without the need of a server of external database,
                  which means <b>I don't even have your data</b>.

                  <p>
                    Midway through my psychology degree, I realized that I would need something extra if I were going to be successful in life.
                    So I designed the hell out of a simple application, thinking the idea was so powerful, it would take off.
                    I encouraged a friend of mine in a computer science undergrad program to help me build it,
                    which is when I discovered that I didn't really know the scope of what I was asking him,
                    and didn't have as detailed a vision as I would need to build out the app.
                     dropped out of school and learn how to code.
